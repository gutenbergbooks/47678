    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he God of Love had
      read the title and the name of this treatise, when he said, "War, I see,
      war is being meditated against me." Forbear, Cupid, to accuse thy Poet of
      such a crime; me, who so oft have borne thy standards with thee for my
      leader. I am no son of Tydeus, wounded by whom, <a href="#linknote-1201"
      name="linknoteref-1201" id="linknoteref-1201"><small>1201</small></a> thy
      mother returned into the yielding air with the steeds of Mars. Other
      youths full oft grow cool; I have ever loved; and shouldst thou inquire
      what I am doing even now, I am still in love. Besides, I have taught by
      what arts thou mayst be won; and that which is now a system, was an
      impulse before. Neither thee do I betray, sweet Boy, nor yet my own arts;
      nor has my more recent Muse unravelled her former work.
    </p>
    <p>
      If any one loves an object which he delights to love, enraptured, in his
      happiness, let him rejoice, and let him sail with prospering gales. But if
      any one impatiently endures the sway of some cruel fair, that he may not
      be undone, let him experience relief from my skill. Why has one person,
      tying up his neck <a href="#linknote-1202" name="linknoteref-1202"
      id="linknoteref-1202"><small>1202</small></a> by the tightened halter,
      hung, a sad burden, from the lofty beam? Why, with the hard iron, has
      another pierced his own entrails? Lover of peace, thou dost bear the blame
      of their deaths. He, who, unless he desists, is about to perish by a
      wretched passion, let him desist; and then thou wilt prove the cause of
      death to none. Besides, thou art a boy; and it becomes thee not to do
      aught but play. Play on; a sportive sway befits thy years. Far thou mayst
      use thy arrows, when drawn from the quiver for warfare; but thy weapons
      are free from deadly blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let thy stepfather Mars wage war both with the sword and the sharp lance;
      and let him go, as victor, blood-stained with plenteous slaughter. Do thou
      cherish thy mother's arts, which, in safety, we pursue; and by the fault
      of which no parent he comes bereft. Do thou cause the portals to be burst
      open in the broils of the night; and let many a chaplet cover the
      decorated doors. Cause the youths and the bashful damsels to meet in
      secret; and by any contrivance they can, let them deceive their watchful
      husbands. And at one moment, let the lover utter blandishments, at
      another, rebukes, against the obdurate door-posts; and, shut out, let him
      sing some doleful ditty. Contented with these tears, thou wilt be without
      the imputation of any death. Thy torch is not deserving to be applied to
      the consuming pile.
    </p>
    <p>
      These words said I. Beauteous Love waved his resplendent wings, and said
      to me, "Complete the work that thou dost design." Come, then, ye deceived
      youths, for my precepts; ye whom your passion has deceived in every way.
      By him, through whom you have learned how to love, learn how to be cured;
      for you, the same hand shall cause the wound and the remedy. The earth
      nourishes wholesome plants, and the same produces injurious ones; and full
      oft is the nettle the neighbour of the rose. That lance which once made a
      wound in the enemy, the son of Hercules, afforded a remedy <a
      href="#linknote-1203" name="linknoteref-1203" id="linknoteref-1203"><small>1203</small></a>
      for that wound. But whatever is addressed to the men, believe, ye fair, to
      be said to you as well; to both sides am I giving arms. If of these any
      are not suited to your use, still by their example they may afford much
      instruction. My useful purpose is to extinguish the raging flames, and not
      to have the mind the slave of its own imperfections. Phyllis would have
      survived, if she had employed me as her teacher; and along that road, by
      which nine times she went,<a href="#linknote-1204" name="linknoteref-1204"
      id="linknoteref-1204"><small>1204</small></a> she would have gone oftener
      still. And Dido, dying, would not have beheld from the summit of her tower
      the Dardanian ships giving their sails to the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grief, too, would not have armed Medea, the mother against her own
      offspring; she who took vengeance on her husband, by the shedding of their
      united blood. Through my skill, Tereus, although Philomela did captivate
      him, would not, through his crimes, have been deserving to become a bird.
      <a href="#linknote-1205" name="linknoteref-1205" id="linknoteref-1205"><small>1205</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Give me Pasiphaë for a pupil, at once she shall lay aside her passion for
      the bull; give me Phædra, the shocking passion of Phædra shall depart.
      Bring Paris back to us; Menelaus shall possess his Helen, and Pergamus
      shall not fall, conquered by Grecian hands. If impious Scylla had read my
      treatise, the purple lock, Nisus, would have remained upon thy head. With
      me for your guide, ye men, repress your pernicious anxieties; and onward
      let the bark proceed with the companions, me the pilot. At the time when
      you were learning how to love, Naso was to be studied; now, too, will the
      same Naso have to be studied by you. An universal assertor <a
      href="#linknote-1206" name="linknoteref-1206" id="linknoteref-1206"><small>1206</small></a>
      of liberty, I will relieve the breasts that are oppressed by their
      tyrants; do you show favour, each of you, to my liberating wand. <a
      href="#linknote-1207" name="linknoteref-1207" id="linknoteref-1207"><small>1207</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Prophetic Phoebus, inventor of song, and of the healing art, I pray that
      the laurel may afford me its aid. Do thou shew favour both to the poet and
      to the physician; to thy guardianship is either care consigned.
    </p>
    <p>
      While still you may, and while moderate emotions influence your breast; if
      you repent, withhold your footsteps upon the very threshold. Tread under
      foot the hurtful seeds of the sudden malady, while they are still fresh;
      and let your steed, as he begins to go, refuse to proceed. For time
      supplies strength, time thoroughly ripens the young grapes; and it makes
      that into vigorous standing corn, which before was only blades of grass.
      The tree which affords its extending shade to those who walk beneath, was
      but a twig at the time when it was first planted. At that time, with the
      hand it could have been rooted from the surface of the earth; now,
      increased by its own powers, it is standing upon a large space. Examine
      with active perception, what sort of object it is, with which you are in
      love; and withdraw your neck from a yoke that is sure to gall. Resist the
      first advances; too late is a cure attempted, when through long hesitation
      the malady has waxed strong. But hasten, and do not postpone to a future
      moment; that which is not agreeable to-day, will to-morrow be still less
      so. Every passion is deceiving, and finds nutriment in delay. Each day's
      morrow is the best suited for liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      You see but few rivers arise from great sources; most of them are
      multiplied by a collection of waters. If thou hadst at once perceived how
      great a sin thou wast meditating, thou wouldst not, Myrrha, have had thy
      features covered with bark. I have seen a wound, which at first was
      curable, when neglected receive injury from protracted delay. But because
      we are delighted to pluck the flowers of Venus, we are continually saying,
      "This will be done to-morrow just as well." In the meantime, the silent
      flames are gliding into the entrails; and the hurtful tree is sending its
      roots more deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if the time for early aid has now passed by, and an old passion is
      seated deeply in your captured breast, a greater labour is provided; but,
      because I am called in but late to the sick, he shall not be deserted by
      me. With unerring hand the hero, son of Peeas, <a href="#linknote-1208"
      name="linknoteref-1208" id="linknoteref-1208"><small>1208</small></a>
      ought at once to have cutout the part in which he was wounded. Still,
      after many a year, he is supposed, when cured, to have given a finishing
      hand to the warfare. I, who just now was hastening to dispel maladies at
      their birth, am now tardy in administering aid to you at a later moment.
      Either try, if you can, to extinguish the flames when recent; or when they
      have become exhausted by their own efforts. When frenzy is in full career,
      yield to frenzy in its career; each impulse presents a difficult access.
      The swimmer is a fool, who, when he can cross the stream by going down
      with it sideways, struggles to go straight against the tide. A mind
      impatient, and not yet manageable by any contrivance, rejects the words of
      an adviser, and holds them in contempt. More successfully, then, shall I
      attempt it when he shall now allow his wounds to be touched, and shall be
      accessible to the words of truthfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who, but one bereft of understanding, would forbid a mother to weep at the
      death of her son? On such an occasion she is not to be counselled. When
      she shall have exhausted her tears, and have satisfied her afflicted
      feelings; that grief of hers will be capable of being soothed with words.
      The healing art is generally a work of opportunity; wine, administered at
      the proper time, is beneficial, and administered at an unsuitable time, is
      injurious. And, besides, you may inflame maladies and irritate them by
      checking them; if you do not combat them at the fitting moment.'
      Therefore, when you shall seem to be curable by my skill, take care, and
      by my precepts shun the first approaches of idleness. 'Tis that which
      makes you love, 'tis that which supports it, when once it has caused it:
      that is the cause and the nutriment of the delightful malady.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you remove all idleness, the bow of Cupid is broken, and his torch lies
      despised and without its light. As much as the plane-tree <a
      href="#linknote-1209" name="linknoteref-1209" id="linknoteref-1209"><small>1209</small></a>
      delights in wine, the multitude in the stream, and as much as the reed of
      the marsh in a slimy soil, so much does Venus love idleness. You who seek
      a termination of your passion, attend to your business; love gives way
      before business; then you will be safe. Inactivity, and immoderate
      slumbers under no control, gaming too, and the temples aching through much
      wine, take away all strength 'from the mind that is free from a wound.
      Love glides insidiously upon the unwary. That Boy is wont to attend upon
      slothfulness; he hates the busy. Give to the mind that is unemployed some
      task with which it may be occupied. There are the Courts, there are the
      laws, there are your friends for you to defend.<a href="#linknote-1210"
      name="linknoteref-1210" id="linknoteref-1210"><small>1210</small></a> Go
      into the ranks <a href="#linknote-1211" name="linknoteref-1211"
      id="linknoteref-1211"><small>1211</small></a> white with the civic gown;
      or else do you take up with the youthful duties of bloodstained Mars; soon
      will voluptuousness turn its back on you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lo! the flying Parthian, <a href="#linknote-1212" name="linknoteref-1212"
      id="linknoteref-1212"><small>1212</small></a> a recent cause for a great
      triumph, is now beholding the arms of Caesar on his own plains. Conquer
      equally the arrows of Cupid and of the Parthians, and bring back a
      two-fold trophy to the Gods of your country. After Venus had once been
      wounded by the Ætolian <a href="#linknote-1213" name="linknoteref-1213"
      id="linknoteref-1213"><small>1213</small></a> spear, she entrusted wars to
      be waged by her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you enquire why Ægisthus became an adulterer? The cause is
      self-evident; he was an idler. Others were fighting at Ilium, with slowly
      prospering arms: the whole of Greece had transported thither her strength.
      If he would have given his attention to war, she was nowhere waging it; <a
      href="#linknote-1214" name="linknoteref-1214" id="linknoteref-1214"><small>1214</small></a>
      or if to the Courts of law, Argos was free from litigation. What he could,
      he did; that he might not be doing nothing, he fell in love. Thus does
      that Boy make his approaches, so does that Boy take up his abode.
    </p>
    <p>
      The country, too, soothes the feelings, and the pursuits of agriculture:
      any anxiety whatever may give way before this employment. Bid the tamed
      oxen place their necks beneath their burden, that the crooked ploughshare
      may wound the hard ground. Cover the grain of Ceres with the earth turned
      up, which the field may restore to you with bounteous interest. Behold the
      branches bending beneath the weight of the apples; how its own tree can
      hardly support the weight which it has produced. See the rivulets
      trickling along with their pleasing murmur; see the sheep, as they crop
      the fertile mead. Behold how the she-goats climb the rocks, and the steep
      crags; soon will they be bringing back their distended udders for their
      kids. The shepherd is tuning his song on the unequal reeds; the dogs, too,
      a watchful throng, are not far off. In another direction the lofty woods
      are resounding with lowings; and the dam is complaining that her calf is
      missing. Why name the time when the swarms fly from the yew trees, <a
      href="#linknote-1215" name="linknoteref-1215" id="linknoteref-1215"><small>1215</small></a>
      placed beneath them, that the honey-combs removed may relieve the bending
      osiers <a href="#linknote-1216" name="linknoteref-1216"
      id="linknoteref-1216"><small>1216</small></a> of their weight? Autumn
      affords its fruit; summer is beauteous with its harvests; spring produces
      flowers; winter is made cheerful by the fire. At stated periods the rustic
      pulls the ripened grape, and beneath his naked foot the juice flows out;
      at stated periods he binds up the dried hay, and clears the mowed ground
      with the wide toothed rake.
    </p>
    <p>
      You yourself may set the plant in the watered garden; you yourself may
      form the channels for the trickling stream. The grafting <a
      href="#linknote-1217" name="linknoteref-1217" id="linknoteref-1217"><small>1217</small></a>
      is now come; make branch adopt branch, and let one tree stand covered with
      the foliage of another. When once these delights have begun to soothe your
      mind, Love, robbed of his power, departs with flagging wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or do you follow the pursuit of hunting. Full oft has Venus, overcome by
      the sister of Phoebus, retreated in disgrace. Now follow the fleet hare
      with the quick-scented hound; now stretch your toils on the shady mountain
      ridge. Or else, alarm the timid deer with the variegated feather-foils; or
      let the boar fall, transfixed by the hostile spear. Fatigued, at night
      sleep takes possession of you, not thoughts of the fair; and with profound
      rest it refreshes the limbs. 'Tis a more tranquil pursuit, still it is a
      pursuit, on catching the bird, to win the humble prize, either with the
      net or with the bird-limed twigs; or else, to hide the crooked hooks of
      brass in morsels at the end, which the greedy fish may, to its
      destruction, swallow with its ravenous jaws. Either by these, or by other
      pursuits, must you by stealth be beguiled by yourself, until you shall
      have learnt how to cease to love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only do you go, although you shall be detained by strong ties, go far
      away, and commence your progress upon a distant journey. You will weep
      when the name of your forsaken mistress shall recur to you: and many a
      time will your foot linger in the middle of your path. But the less
      willing you shall be to go, remember the more surely to go; persist; and
      compel your feet to hasten, however unwillingly. And don't you fear
      showers; nor let the Sabbaths <a href="#linknote-1218"
      name="linknoteref-1218" id="linknoteref-1218"><small>1218</small></a> of
      the stranger detain you; nor yet the Allia, <a href="#linknote-1219"
      name="linknoteref-1219" id="linknoteref-1219"><small>1219</small></a> so
      well known for its disasters. And don't enquire how many miles you have
      travelled, but how many are yet remaining for you; and invent no excuses,
      that you may remain near at hand. Neither do you count the hours, nor oft
      look back on Rome: but fly; still is <a href="#linknote-1220"
      name="linknoteref-1220" id="linknoteref-1220"><small>1220</small></a> the
      Parthian secure in flight from his foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one may style my precepts harsh: I confess that they are harsh; but
      that you may recover, you will have to endure much that is to be lamented.
      Full oft, when ill, I have drunk of bitter potions, though reluctantly;
      and when I entreated for it, food has been refused me. To cure your body,
      you will have to endure iron and fire; and though thirsty, you will not
      refresh your parched lips with water. That you may be healed in spirit,
      will you refuse to submit to anything? Inasmuch as that part is ever of
      greater value than the body. But still, most difficult is the access to my
      art; and the one labour is how to endure the first moments of separation.
      Do you perceive how the yoke, at first, galls the oxen when caught? how
      the new girth hurts the flying steed?
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps you will be loth to depart from your paternal home. But still you
      will depart; then you will be longing to return. No paternal home, but <a
      href="#linknote-1221" name="linknoteref-1221" id="linknoteref-1221"><small>1221</small></a>
      the love of your mistress, cloaking its own faultiness by specious words,
      will be calling you back. When once you have gone, the country, and your
      companions, and the long journey will afford a thousand solaces for your
      sorrow. And do not think it is enough to depart; be absent for a long
      time, until the flame has lost its power and the ashes are without their
      fire. If you shall hasten to return, except with your judgment
      strengthened, rebellious Love will be wielding his cruel arms against you.
      Suppose that, although you shall have absented yourself, you return both
      hungry and thirsty; will not all this delay even act to your detriment?

      If any one supposes that the noxious herbs of the Hæmonian lands and magic
      arts can be of avail, let him see to it. That is the old-fashioned method
      of sorcery; my Apollo, in his hallowed lines, is pointing out an innoxious
      art. Under my guidance, no ghost shall be summoned to come forth <a
      href="#linknote-1222" name="linknoteref-1222" id="linknoteref-1222"><small>1222</small></a>
      from the tomb; no hag with her disgusting spells shall cleave the ground.
      No crops of corn shall remove from one field into another; nor shall the
      disk of Phoebus suddenly be pale. Tiberinus <a href="#linknote-1223"
      name="linknoteref-1223" id="linknoteref-1223"><small>1223</small></a>
      shall flow into the waves of the ocean just as he is wont; just as she is
      wont, shall the Moon be borne by her snow-White steeds. No breasts shall
      lay aside their cares dispelled by enchantments; vanquished by virgin
      sulphur, <a href="#linknote-1224" name="linknoteref-1224"
      id="linknoteref-1224"><small>1224</small></a> love shall not take to
      flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colchian damsel, what did the herbs of the Phasian land avail thee, when
      thou didst desire to remain in thy native home? Of what use, Circe, were
      the herbs of thy mother Persia to thee, when the favouring breeze bore
      away the barks of Neritos? <a href="#linknote-1225" name="linknoteref-1225"
      id="linknoteref-1225"><small>1225</small></a> Every thing didst thou do
      that thy crafty guest might not depart; still did he give his filled sails
      to an assured flight.. Every thing didst thou do that the fierce flames
      might not consume thee; still a lasting passion settled deep in thy
      reluctant breast. Thou, who wast able to change men into a thousand
      shapes, wast not able to change the bent of thy own inclination. Thou art
      said to have detained the Lulicillan chief, <a href="#linknote-1226"
      name="linknoteref-1226" id="linknoteref-1226"><small>1226</small></a> when
      now he wished to depart, even in these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not now entreat that which, as I remember, I was at first wont to
      hope for, that thou shouldst consent to be my husband. And still, I did
      seem worthy to be thy wife, since I was a Goddess, since I was the
      daughter of the Sun. Hasten not away, I entreat thee; a little delay, as a
      favour, do I ask. What less can he prayed for by my entreaties? Thou
      seest, too, that the seas are troubled; and of them thou oughtst to stand
      in dread. Before long, the winds will be more favourable to thy sails.
      What is the cause of thy flight? No Troy is rising here anew; no fresh
      Rhesus is calling his companions to arms. Here love abides, here peace
      exists; during which I alone am fatally wounded; the whole, too, of my
      realms shall be under thy sway."
    </p>
    <p>
      She thus spoke; Ulysses unmoored his bark; the South winds bore away her
      unavailing words together with his sails. Circe was inflamed, and had
      recourse to her wonted arts; and still by them her passion was not
      diminished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Come, then, whoever you are, that require aid from my skill, away with all
      belief in spells and charms. If some weighty reason shall detain you in
      the City mistress of the world, hear what is my advice in the City. He is
      the best assertor of his liberties who bursts the chains that gall his
      breast, and once for all ceases to grieve. If any one has so much courage,
      even I myself will admire him, and I shall say, "This man stands in no
      need of my admonitions." You who with difficulty are learning how not to
      love the object which you love; who are not able, and still would wish to
      be able, will require to be instructed by me. Full oft recall to your
      remembrance the deeds of the perfidious fair one, and place all your
      losses before your eyes.' Say, "This thing and that of mine does she keep;
      and not content with that spoliation, she has put up for sale <a
      href="#linknote-1227" name="linknoteref-1227" id="linknoteref-1227"><small>1227</small></a>
      my paternal home. Thus did she swear to me; thus having sworn, did she
      deceive me. How oft has she suffered me to be before her doors! She
      herself loves other men; by me she loathes to be loved. Some hawker, <a
      href="#linknote-1228" name="linknoteref-1228" id="linknoteref-1228"><small>1228</small></a>
      alas! enjoys those nights which she grants not to myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Let all these points ferment throughout your entire feelings; repeat them
      over and over hence seek the first germs of your hate. And would that you
      could be even eloquent upon them! Do' you only grieve; of your own accord
      you will be fluent. My attentions were lately paid to a certain fair one;
      to my passion she was not favourably disposed. Sick, like Podalirius, <a
      href="#linknote-1229" name="linknoteref-1229" id="linknoteref-1229"><small>1229</small></a>
      I cured myself with the proper herbs, and (I confess it) though a
      physician, to my shame, I was sick. It did me good to be ever dwelling
      upon the failings of my mistress; and that, when done, often proved
      wholesome for me. "How ill formed," I used to say, "are the legs of my
      mistress!" and yet, to confess the truth, they were not. "How far from
      beautiful are the arms of my mistress!" and yet, to confess the truth,
      they were. "How short she is!" and yet she was not; "How much does she beg
      of her lover?" From that arose the greatest cause of my hatred.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are good qualities, too, near akin to bad ones; by reason of
      confounding one for the other, <a href="#linknote-1230"
      name="linknoteref-1230" id="linknoteref-1230"><small>1230</small></a> a
      virtue has often borne the blame for a vice. So far as you can, depreciate
      the endowments of the fair one, and impose upon your own judgment by the
      narrow line that separates good from bad. If she is embonpoint, let her be
      called flabby, if she is swarthy, black. Leanness may be charged against
      her slender form. She, too, who is not coy may be pronounced bold; and if
      she is discreet, she may be pronounced a prude. Besides, in whatever
      accomplishment your mistress is deficient, ever be entreating her, in
      complimentary accents, to turn her attention to the same. If any damsel is
      without a voice, request her to sing; if any fair one does not know how to
      move her hands <a href="#linknote-1231" name="linknoteref-1231"
      id="linknoteref-1231"><small>1231</small></a> with gracefulness, make her
      dance. Is she imeouth in her language, make her talk frequently to you;
      has she not learnt how to touch the strings, call for the lyre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Does she walk heavily, make her walk; does a swelling bosom cover all her
      breast, let no stomacher <a href="#linknote-1232" name="linknoteref-1232"
      id="linknoteref-1232"><small>1232</small></a> conceal it. If her teeth are
      bad, tell her something for her to laugh at: is she tender-eyed, relate
      something for her to weep at.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be of use, too, for you, early in the morning suddenly, to turn
      your hasty steps towards your mistress, when she has dressed for no one.
      By dress are we enchanted; by gems and gold all things are concealed; the
      fair one herself is but a very trifling part of herself. Often, amid
      objects so many, you may inquire what it is that you love. By this Ægis <a
      href="#linknote-1233" name="linknoteref-1233" id="linknoteref-1233"><small>1233</small></a>
      does Love, amid his riches, deceive the eye. Come unexpectedly; in safety
      to yourself you will find her unarmed; to her misfortune, through her own
      failings will she fall. Still, it is not safe to trust too much to this
      precept, for without the resources of art a graceful form captivates many.
      At the moment, too, when she shall be smearing her face with the cosmetics
      laid on it, you may come in the presence of your mistress, and don't let
      shame prevent you. You will find there boxes, and a thousand colours of
      objects; and you will see cesypum, the ointment of the fleece, <a
      href="#linknote-1234" name="linknoteref-1234" id="linknoteref-1234"><small>1234</small></a>
      trickling down and flowing upon her heated bosom. These drugs, Phineus,
      smell like thy tables; <a href="#linknote-1235" name="linknoteref-1235"
      id="linknoteref-1235"><small>1235</small></a> not once only has sickness
      been caused by this to my stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now will I disclose to you, what should be done in the moments of your
      transport; from every quarter must love be put to flight. Many of them,
      indeed, I am ashamed to mention; but do you conceive in your imagination
      even more than lies in my words. For, of late, certain persons have been
      blaming my treatises, in the opinion of whom my Muse is wanton. If I only
      please, and so long as I am celebrated all the world over, let this person
      or that attack my work just as he likes. Envy detracts from the genius of
      mighty Homer; whoever thou art, from him, Zoilus, <a href="#linknote-1236"
      name="linknoteref-1236" id="linknoteref-1236"><small>1236</small></a> dost
      thou derive thy fame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sacrilegious hands have also mangled thy poems, <a href="#linknote-1237"
      name="linknoteref-1237" id="linknoteref-1237"><small>1237</small></a>
      thou, under whose guidance Troy brought hither her conquered Divinities.
      Envy takes a lofty flight; on high the breezes sweep along; the lightnings
      hurled by the right hand of Jove take a lofty range.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you, whoever you are, whom my freedom offends, require, if you are
      wise, each subject for its proper numbers. <a href="#linknote-1238"
      name="linknoteref-1238" id="linknoteref-1238"><small>1238</small></a> Bold
      warfare delights to be related in the Mæonian measure. What place can
      there be there for <i>gentle</i> dalliance? The Tragedians speak in lofty
      tones; anger befits the buskin of Tragedy; the sock <i>of Comedy</i> <a
      href="#linknote-1239" name="linknoteref-1239" id="linknoteref-1239"><small>1239</small></a>
      must be furnished from the manners of every-day life. The free Iambic
      measure may be launched against the hostile foe; whether it be rapid, or
      whether it drag on its foot <a href="#linknote-1240"
      name="linknoteref-1240" id="linknoteref-1240"><small>1240</small></a> at
      its close. Soft Elegy should sing of the Loves with their quivers, and the
      sprightly mistress ought to sport according to her own inclination.
      Achilles is not to be celebrated in the numbers of Callimachus; Cydippe <a
      href="#linknote-1241" name="linknoteref-1241" id="linknoteref-1241"><small>1241</small></a>
      belongs not, Homer, to thy song. Who could endure Thais performing the
      part of Andromache? <a href="#linknote-1242" name="linknoteref-1242"
      id="linknoteref-1242"><small>1242</small></a> If any one were to act Thais
      in the tones of Andromache, he would be making a mistake. Thais belongs to
      my purse; licence unrestrained belongs to me. Nought have I to do with the
      fillet <i>of chastity</i>; Thais belongs to my pursuit. If my Muse is
      befitting a sportive subject, I have conquered, and on a false charge she
      has been accused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burst thyself, gnawing Envy; now have I gained great fame;'twill be still
      greater, let it only proceed with the steps with which it has commenced.
      But you are making too great haste; let me only live, you shall have more
      to complain of; my intentions, too, embrace full many a poem. For it gives
      me delight, and my zeal increases with my eagerness for fame; at the
      beginning of the ascent only is my steed now panting. Elegy acknowledges
      that to me she is as much indebted as is the noble Epic <a
      href="#linknote-1243" name="linknoteref-1243" id="linknoteref-1243"><small>1243</small></a>
      to Virgil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus far do I give an answer to Envy; tighten the reins with more vigour,
      and speed onward, Poet, in thy circle.

      And 'tis no hard matter to do this; few women confess the truth to
      themselves; and there is no point in which they think that they are
      unbecoming. Then, too, I recommend you to open all the windows, and to
      remark in full daylight the limbs that are unsightly. But as soon as your
      transports have come to a termination, and the body with the mind lies
      entirely exhausted; while you are feeling regret, and wishing that you had
      formed a connexion with no female, and are seeming to yourself that for a
      long time you will have nothing to do with another; then note in your
      memory whatever blemishes there are in her person; and keep your eyes
      always fixed upon her faulty points.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps some one will pronounce these matters trivial (for indeed they are
      so); but things which, singly, are of no avail, when united are of
      benefit. The little viper kills with its sting the bulky bull; by the dog
      that is not large, full oft is the boar held fast. Do you only fight with
      a number of them, and unite my precepts together; from so many there will
      be a large amount. But since there are so many ways and attitudes, every
      point is not to be yielded to my recommendations. Perhaps, in the opinion
      of another, that will be a fault, by the doing of which your feelings may
      not be hurt. Because this person, perchance, has seen the charms of the
      naked person exposed, his passion, which was in mid career, stops short:
      another, when his mistress has received him, has been shocked at some
      sight which creates disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! if these things could influence you, you are trifling; torches but
      luke-warm have been influencing your breast. That Boy would more strongly
      draw his bended bow: you, ye wounded throng, will need more a substantial
      aid. What think you of the man who lies concealed, and beholds sights that
      usage itself forbids him to see? May the Gods forbid that I should advise
      any one to adopt such a course! Though it should prove of use, still it
      should not be tried.
    </p>
    <p>
      I advise you, also, to have two mistresses at the same time. If a person
      can have still more, he is more secure. When the feelings, sundered into
      two parts, are wavering in each direction, the one passion diminishes the
      strength of the other. By many streamlets are great rivers lessened, and
      the exhausted flame, the fuel withdrawn, goes out. But one anchor does not
      sufficiently hold the waxed ships; a single hook is not enough for the
      flowing stream. He who beforehand has provided for himself a twofold
      solace, has already proved the victor in the lofty citadel. But, by you,
      who, to your misfortune, have devoted yourself to but one mistress, now,
      at all events, a new passion must be sought. For Procris <a
      href="#linknote-1244" name="linknoteref-1244" id="linknoteref-1244"><small>1244</small></a>
      did Minos abandon his flame for Pasiphaë; overcome by the wife from Ida,
      <a href="#linknote-1245" name="linknoteref-1245" id="linknoteref-1245"><small>1245</small></a>
      the first wife gave way. Calirrhoë, received to a share of his couch,
      caused the brother of <a href="#linknote-1246" name="linknoteref-1246"
      id="linknoteref-1246"><small>1246</small></a> Amphilochus not always to be
      in love with the daughter of Phegeus. Oeuone, too, would have retained
      Paris to her latest years, if she had not been supplanted by her Aebalian
      rival. The beauty of his wife would have pleased the Odrysian <a
      href="#linknote-1247" name="linknoteref-1247" id="linknoteref-1247"><small>1247</small></a>
      tyrant, but superior were the charms of her imprisoned sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why occupy myself with illustrations, the number of which exhausts me?
      Every passion is conquered by a fresh successor. With greater fortitude
      does a mother regret one out of many, than she who, <a
      href="#linknote-1248" name="linknoteref-1248" id="linknoteref-1248"><small>1248</small></a>
      weeping, exclaims: "Thou wast my only one." But lest, perchance, you
      should suppose that I am framing new laws for you, (and would that the
      glory of the discovery were my own!) the son of Atreus perceived this; for
      what could he not see, under whose command was the whole of Greece? He,
      victorious, loved Chryseis, captured by his own arms; but her aged parent
      foolishly went crying in every direction. Why dost thou weep, troublesome
      old man? They are well suited for each other. By thy affection, foolish
      man, thou art doing an injury to thy child. After Calchas, secure under
      the protection of Achilles, had ordered <a href="#linknote-1249"
      name="linknoteref-1249" id="linknoteref-1249"><small>1249</small></a> her
      to be restored, and she was received back to the house of her father:
      "There is," said the son of Atreus, "another fair one very closely
      resembling her beauty; and if the first syllable <a href="#linknote-1250"
      name="linknoteref-1250" id="linknoteref-1250"><small>1250</small></a>
      would allow of it, the name would, be the same; Achilles, if he were wise,
      would give her up to me of his own accord; if not, he will experience my
      might. But if any one of you, ye Greeks, disapproves of this deed;'tis
      something to wield the sceptre with a powerful hand. For if I am your
      king, and if she does not pass her nights with me, then let Thersites
      succeed to my sway." Thus he said; and he had her as his great consolation
      for her predecessor; and the first passion was entombed in a new passion.
      By the example, then, of Agamemnon, admit a fresh flame, that your love
      may be severed in two directions. If you inquire where you are to find
      them? Go and read through my treatises on the art of Love; then may your
      bark speed on, well freighted with the fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if my precepts are of any avail, if by my lips Apollo teaches aught
      that is advantageous to mortals; although, to your misfortune, you should
      be burning in the midst of Ætna, take care to appear to your mistress more
      cold than ice. Pretend, too, that you are unhurt; if, perchance, you
      should grieve at all, let her not perceive it; and laugh when, within
      yourself, you could have wept. I do not bid you to sever your passion in
      the very midst; the laws of my sway are not so harsh as that. Pretend to
      be that which you are not, and feign that your ardour is renounced; so, in
      reality, you will become what you are practising to be. Often, that I
      might not drink, I have wished to appear asleep; <a href="#linknote-1251"
      name="linknoteref-1251" id="linknoteref-1251"><small>1251</small></a>
      while I have so seemed, I have surrendered my conquered eyes to slumber. I
      have laughed at his being deceived, who was pretending that he was in
      love; and the fowler has fallen into his own nets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through habit does love enter the mind; through habit is it forgotten. He
      who will, be able to pretend that he is unhurt, will be unhurt. Does she
      tell you to come on a night appointed, do you come. Should you come, and
      the gate be closed; put up with it. Neither utter blandishments, nor yet
      utter reproaches against the door-post, and do not lay down your sides
      upon the hard threshold. The next morning comes; let your words be without
      complaints, and bear no signs of grief upon your features. She will soon
      lay aside her haughtiness, when she shall see you growing cool: this
      advantage, too, will you be gaining from my skill. And yet do you deceive
      yourself as well, and let not this <a href="#linknote-1252"
      name="linknoteref-1252" id="linknoteref-1252"><small>1252</small></a> be
      the end of your love. Full oft does the horse struggle against the reins
      when presented. Let your object lie concealed; that will come to pass
      which you shall not avow. The nets that are too easily seen, the bird
      avoids.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let her not congratulate herself so much that she can hold you in
      contempt; take courage, that to your courage she may yield. Her door is
      open, perchance; though she should call you back, do you go out. A night
      is named; doubt whether you can come on the night appointed.'Tis an easy
      thing to be able to endure this; unless you are deficient in wisdom, you
      may more readily derive amusement from one more condescending. And can any
      person call my precepts harsh? Why, I am acting the part of a reconciler
      even. For as some dispositions vary, I am varying my precepts as well.
      There are a thousand forms of the malady; a thousand forms of cure will
      there be. Some bodies are with difficulty healed by the sharp iron:
      potions and herbs have proved an aid to many. You are too weak, and cannot
      go away, and are held in bonds, and cruel Love is treading your neck
      beneath his foot. Cease your struggling; let the winds bring back your
      sails; and whither the tide calls you, thither let your oars proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      That thirst, parched by which you are perishing, must be satisfied by you;
      I permit it; now may you drink in the midst of the stream. But drink even
      more than what your appetite requires; make the water you have swallowed
      flow back from your filled throat. Always enjoy the company of your
      mistress, no one preventing it; let her occupy your nights, her your days.
      Make satiety your object; satiety puts an end to evils even. And even now,
      when you think you can do without her, do you remain with her. Until you
      have fully cloyed yourself, and satiety removes your passion, let it not
      please you to move from the house you loathe. That love, too, which
      distrust nurtures, is of long endurance; should you wish to lay this
      aside, lay aside your apprehensions. Who fears that she may not be his
      own, and that some one may rob him of her, that person will be hardly
      curable with the skill of Machaon. Of two sons, a mother generally loves
      him the most, for whose return she feels apprehensions, because he is
      bearing arms.

    <p>
      There is, near the Collinian <a href="#linknote-1253"
      name="linknoteref-1253" id="linknoteref-1253"><small>1253</small></a>
      gate, a venerable temple; the lofty Ervx gave this temple its name. There,
      is Lethæan Love, who heals the mind; and in cold water does he place his
      torches. There, too, in their prayers, do the youths pray for
      forgetfulness; and any fair one, if she has been smitten by an obdurate
      man. He thus said to me; (I am in doubt whether it was the real Cupid, or
      whether a vision; but I think it was a vision.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "O Naso, thou who dost sometimes cause, sometimes relieve, the passion
      full of anxiety, add this to thy precepts as well. Let each person recall
      to mind his own mishaps; let him dismiss love; to all has the Deity
      assigned more or less of woes. He that stands in awe of the Puteal <a
      href="#linknote-1254" name="linknoteref-1254" id="linknoteref-1254"><small>1254</small></a>
      and of Janus, <a href="#linknote-1255" name="linknoteref-1255"
      id="linknoteref-1255"><small>1255</small></a> and of the Calends swiftly
      coming, let the borrowed sum of money be his torment. He whose father is
      harsh, though other things should prove to his wish, before his eyes must
      his harsh father be placed. Another one is living wretchedly with a wife
      poorly dowried, let him think that his wife is an obstacle to his fortune.
      You have a vineyard, on a generous soil, fruitful in choice grapes; be in
      dread lest the shooting grape should be blighted. Another has à ship on
      its return home; <a href="#linknote-1256" name="linknoteref-1256"
      id="linknoteref-1256"><small>1256</small></a> let him be always thinking
      that the sea is boisterous, and that the sea-shore is polluted by his
      losses. Let a son in service <a href="#linknote-1257"
      name="linknoteref-1257" id="linknoteref-1257"><small>1257</small></a> be
      the torment of one, a marriageable daughter of yourself. And who is there
      that has not a thousand causes for anxiety? That, Paris, thou mightst hate
      thine own <i>cause of sorrow</i>, thou oughtst to have placed the deaths
      of thy brothers before thine eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Still more was he saying, when the childish form deserted my placid
      slumber, if slumber only it was. What am I to do? In the midst of the
      waves Palinurus <a href="#linknote-1258" name="linknoteref-1258"
      id="linknoteref-1258"><small>1258</small></a> deserts my bark; I am forced
      to enter on an unknown track. Whoever you are that love, avoid solitary
      spots; solitary spots are injurious. Whither are you flying? In the throng
      you may be in greater safety. You have no need of lonely places (lonesome
      spots increase the frenzy); the multitude will bring you aid. You will be
      sad, if you are alone; and before your eyes will stand the form of your
      forsaken mistress, as though her own self. For this reason is the night
      more melancholy than the hours of sunshine; the throng of your companions
      is then wanting to moderate your affliction.
    </p>
    <p>
      And fly not from conversation, nor let your door be closed; and do not, in
      tears, hide your countenance in the shade. Always have a Pylades to
      console his Orestes; this, too, will prove no slight advantage in
      friendship. What but the solitary woods injured Phyllis? The cause of her
      death is well known; she was without a companion. She was going, just as
      the barbarous multitude celebrating the triennial <a href="#linknote-1259"
      name="linknoteref-1259" id="linknoteref-1259"><small>1259</small></a>
      sacrifice to the Edonian <a href="#linknote-1260" name="linknoteref-1260"
      id="linknoteref-1260"><small>1260</small></a> Bacchus, is wont to go, with
      dishevelled locks. And at one time, as far as she could, she looked out
      upon the wide ocean; at another, in her weariness, she lay her down upon
      the sandy shore. "Perfidious Demophoon!" she cried aloud to the deaf
      waves; and her words, as she grieved, were interrupted by sobs. There was
      a narrow path, a little darkened by the long shadows, along which, full
      oft, did she turn her steps towards the sea. Her ninth journey was being
      paced by her in her wretchedness. "See thou to this," says she; and,
      turning pale, she eyes her girdle. She looks, too, on the boughs; she
      hesitates, and she recoils at that which she dares to do; and she
      shudders, and then she raises her fingers to her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sithonian damsel, I would that, then, at least, thou hadst not been alone;
      ye woods, your foliage lost, <a href="#linknote-1261"
      name="linknoteref-1261" id="linknoteref-1261"><small>1261</small></a> you
      would not then have lamented Phyllis. Ye men that are offended by your
      mistresses, ye fair that are affronted by the men, from the example of
      Phyllis, shun too lonesome spots. A youth had done whatever my Muse
      recommended him, and was almost in the haven of his safety. When he came
      amid the eager lovers, he relapsed, and Love resumed the weapons which he
      had laid aside. If any one of you is loving, and does not wish to do so;
      do you take care, and avoid the contagion. This is often wont to injure
      the herds as well. While the eyes are looking on the wounded, they
      themselves are also wounded; many things, too, injure the body by
      infection. Sometimes water flows from a river that runs near into a spot
      parched with its dry clods. Love flows on concealedly, if you do not
      withdraw from him who loves; and we are all of us a set clever at running
      that risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      A second one had now been healed; his nearness to her affected him. He
      proved unable to endure meeting with his mistress. The scar, not
      sufficiently closed, changed again into the former wound; and my skill met
      with no success. The fire next door is guarded against with
      difficulty;'tis prudent to keep away from the neighbouring haunts. Let not
      that Portico which is wont to receive her as she walks, receive you as
      well; and let not the same attentions now be paid. Of what use is it to
      rekindle the feelings, that have cooled, by my advice? Another region must
      be resorted to, if you can do so. When hungry, you will not be easily
      restrained, the table being laid; the gushing water, too, provokes
      excessive thirst.'Tis no easy matter to hold back the bull when he sees
      the heifer; on seeing the mare, the high-mettled steed is always neighing
      after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this you have done, when at last you reach the shore, 'tis not enough
      for you to have abandoned her. Both her sister and her mother must bid you
      farewell, her nurse, too, her confidant, and whatever other connexion
      there shall be of your mistress. And let no servant come; and let no
      little handmaid, feigning to weep, say to you in the name of her mistress,
      "Hail!" <a href="#linknote-1262" name="linknoteref-1262"
      id="linknoteref-1262"><small>1262</small></a> Nor yet, though you should
      desire to know, should you ask how she is doing. Defer it; the restraint
      of the tongue will be to its own advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      You, too, who are telling the cause of your liason being discontinued, and
      are relating many things to be complained of about your mistress; forbear
      to complain; so, by being silent, you will be taking a better revenge;
      until she shall vanish from your regrets. And I would rather that you were
      silent, than that you should talk about having cut her. The man who is too
      often saying to many a one, "I love her not," is still in love. But with
      greater certainty is the flame extinguished by degrees, than all of a
      sudden; cease gradually, and you will be safe. The torrent is wont to run
      with greater violence than the uninterrupted river; but yet the one is a
      short-lived, the other a lasting, stream. Let love escape you, and let it
      depart vanishing into thin air, and let it die out by degrees
      imperceptible.
    </p>
    <p>
      But 'tis a crime to hate the fair one so lately loved; such a termination
      as that is befitting a brutal disposition.'Tis enough not to care for her;
      he who terminates his love with hate, either still loves on, or with
      difficulty will cease to be wretched. 'Tis a shocking thing for a man and
      a woman so lately united to be enemies at once; the Appian <a
      href="#linknote-1263" name="linknoteref-1263" id="linknoteref-1263"><small>1263</small></a>
      Goddess herself would not approve of such quarrels as those. Full oft do
      men accuse their mistresses, and still they love them: where no discord
      arises, Love released, through advice, betakes himself away.
    </p>
    <p>
      By chance I was in the company <a href="#linknote-1264"
      name="linknoteref-1264" id="linknoteref-1264"><small>1264</small></a> of a
      young man; a litter contained his mistress; all his expressions were
      shocking from his frightful threats; and now, about to cite her at law, he
      said, "Let her come out of the litter!" She did come out; on seeing his
      mistress, he was dumb. His hands both fell, and his two tablets from out
      of his hands. He rushed into her em braces; and "thus," said he, "do you
      prove the conqueror.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tis more safe, and more becoming, to depart in peace, than from the
      chamber to repair to the litigious Courts. The presents which you have
      given her, request her to keep without litigation; trivial losses are wont
      to be of great benefit. But if any accident should bring you together,
      keep those arms of defence which I am giving, firmly fixed in your mind.
      Then, there is need of arms; here, most valorous man, use your energies.
      By your weapon must Penthesilea be overcome. Now let the rival, now the
      obdurate threshold, when you were her lover, recur to you; now your words
      uttered in vain in presence of the Gods. Neither arrange your hair,
      because you are about to approach her; nor let your robe be seen with
      loose folds <a href="#linknote-1265" name="linknoteref-1265"
      id="linknoteref-1265"><small>1265</small></a> upon the bosom. Have no care
      to be pleasing to the alienated fair one; now make her to be one of the
      multitude so far as you are concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I will tell what especially stands in the way of my endeavours; his
      own example instructing each individual. We cease to love by slow degrees,
      because we hope to be loved ourselves; and while each one is satisfying
      himself, we are ever a credulous set. But do you believe that, in her
      oaths, neither words (for what is there more deceptive than them?) nor the
      immortal Deities have any weight. Take care, too, not to be moved by the
      tears of the fair; they have instructed their eyes how to weep. By arts
      innumerable are the feelings of lovers laid siege to; just as the rock
      that is beaten on every side by the waves of the sea. And do not disclose
      the reasons why you would prefer a separation, nor tell her what you take
      amiss; still, to yourself, ever grieve on.
    </p>
    <p>
      And don't recount her failings, lest she should extenuate them. You
      yourself will prove indulgent; so that her cause will prove better than
      your own cause. He that is silent, is strong in his resolution; he that
      utters many reproaches to the fair one, asks for himself to be satisfied
      by her justification. I would not venture, <a href="#linknote-1266"
      name="linknoteref-1266" id="linknoteref-1266"><small>1266</small></a>
      after the example of him of Dulichium, to dip the vengeful arrows, nor the
      glowing torches, in the stream; I shall not clip the empurpled wings of
      the Boy, the God of Love; nor through my skill shall his hallowed bow be
      unstrung. 'Tis in accordance with prudence, whatever I sing. Give heed to
      me as I sing; and Phoebus, giver of health, as thou art wont, be thou
      propitious to my attempts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phoebus is propitious; his lyre sounds; his quiver resounds. By his signs
      do I recognize the God; Phoebus is propitious. Compare the fleece that has
      been dyed in the cauldrons of Amyclæ <a href="#linknote-1267"
      name="linknoteref-1267" id="linknoteref-1267"><small>1267</small></a> with
      the Tyrian purple; the former will be but dull. Do you, too, compare your
      charmers with the beauteous fair; each one will begin to be ashamed of his
      own mistress. Both Juno and Pallas may have seemed beauteous to Paris: but
      Venus surpassed them both when compared with herself. And not the
      appearance only; compare the manners and the accomplishments as well; only
      let not your passion prejudice your judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      What I shall henceforth sing is but trifling; but trifling as it is, it
      has proved of service to many; among whom I myself was one. Take care not
      to read over again the letters that you have kept of the caressing fair
      one: letters, when read over again, shake even a firm determination. Put
      the whole of them (though unwillingly you should put them) into the
      devouring flames; and say, "May this prove the funeral pile of my
      passion." The daughter of Thestius <a href="#linknote-1268"
      name="linknoteref-1268" id="linknoteref-1268"><small>1268</small></a>
      burned her son Meleager afar off by means of the billet. Will you, with
      hesitation, commit the words of perfidy to the flames? If you can, remove
      her waxen portrait <a href="#linknote-1269" name="linknoteref-1269"
      id="linknoteref-1269"><small>1269</small></a> as well. Why be moved by a
      dumb likeness? By this means was Laodamia undone. Many localities, too,
      have bad effects: fly from the spots that were conscious of your embraces;
      a thousand grounds for sorrow do they contain. Here she has been; here she
      has laid; in that chamber have we slept; here, in the voluptuous night,
      has she yielded to me her embraces.
    </p>
    <p>
      By recollection, love is excited afresh, and the wound renewed is opened;
      a trifling cause is injurious to the sickly. As, if you were to touch
      ashes almost cold with sulphur, they would rekindle, and, from a small
      one, a very great fire would be produced; so, unless you avoid whatever
      renews love, the flame will be kindled afresh, which just now was not
      existing. The Argive ships would fain have fled from Caphareus, <a
      href="#linknote-1270" name="linknoteref-1270" id="linknoteref-1270"><small>1270</small></a>
      and from thee, old man, that didst avenge thy woes with the flames. The
      daughter of Nisus <a href="#linknote-1271" name="linknoteref-1271"
      id="linknoteref-1271"><small>1271</small></a> past by, the cautious
      mariner rejoices. Do you avoid the spots which have proved too delightful
      for you. Let these be your Syrtes; avoid these as your Acroceraunia; <a
      href="#linknote-1272" name="linknoteref-1272" id="linknoteref-1272"><small>1272</small></a>
      here does the ruthless Charybdis vomit forth and swallow down the waves.
      Some things there are which cannot be recommended at the bidding of any
      one; still, the same, if happening by chance, are often wont to be of
      service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Phædra lost her wealth, thou wouldst, Neptune, have spared thy
      descendant; <a href="#linknote-1273" name="linknoteref-1273"
      id="linknoteref-1273"><small>1273</small></a> nor would the bull, sent by
      his ancestor, have startled the steeds. Had you made the Gnossian <a
      href="#linknote-1274" name="linknoteref-1274" id="linknoteref-1274"><small>1274</small></a>
      damsel poor, she would have loved with prudence. Voluptuous passion is
      nourished by opulence. Why was there no one to court Hecale, <a
      href="#linknote-1275" name="linknoteref-1275" id="linknoteref-1275"><small>1275</small></a>
      no one to court Iras? <a href="#linknote-1276" name="linknoteref-1276"
      id="linknoteref-1276"><small>1276</small></a> It was because the one was
      in want, the other a pauper. Poverty has nothing by which to pamper its
      passion; still, this is not of so much consequence, that you should desire
      to be poor.
    </p>
    <p>
      But let it be of so much consequence to you, as not to be indulging
      yourself with the Theatres, until Love has entirely departed from your
      liberated breast. The harps, and the pipes, and the lyres, soften the
      feelings; the voices, too, and the arms, moved to their proper time.
      There, everlastingly, the parts of supposed lovers are being acted <a
      href="#linknote-1277" name="linknoteref-1277" id="linknoteref-1277"><small>1277</small></a>
      in the dance; by his skill, the actor teaches you what to avoid, and what
      is serviceable. Unwillingly must I say it: meddle not with the amorous
      Poets; unnaturally do I myself withhold my own productions. Avoid
      Callimachus; no enemy is he to Love; and together with Callimachus, thou,
      too, bard of Cos, <a href="#linknote-1278" name="linknoteref-1278"
      id="linknoteref-1278"><small>1278</small></a> art injurious. Beyond a
      doubt, Sappho has rendered me more lenient to my mistress; and the Teian
      Muse has imparted manners far from austere. Who can read in safety the
      lines of Tibullus, or thine, thou, whose sole subject Cynthia was? Who,
      after reading Gallus, could retire with obdurate feelings? Even my own
      lines have tones indescribably sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unless Apollo, the inspirer of my work, is deceiving his bard, a rival is
      the especial cause of our torments. But do you refrain from conjuring up
      to yourself any rival; and believe that she lies alone upon her couch.
      Orestes loved Hermione <a href="#linknote-1279" name="linknoteref-1279"
      id="linknoteref-1279"><small>1279</small></a> more intensely for that very
      reason; because she had begun to belong to another man. Why, Menelaiis,
      dost thou grieve? Without thy wife thou didst go to Crete; and thou
      couldst, at thy ease, be absent from thy spouse. Soon as Paris has carried
      her off, then at last thou couldst not do without thy wife; through the
      passion of another was thine own increased. This, too, did Achilles
      lament, in the case of the daughter of Brises, when taken away from him,
      that she was administering to the pleasures of the couch of the son of
      Plisthenes. <a href="#linknote-1280" name="linknoteref-1280"
      id="linknoteref-1280"><small>1280</small></a> And not without reason, <a
      href="#linknote-1281" name="linknoteref-1281" id="linknoteref-1281"><small>1281</small></a>
      believe me, did he lament. The son of Atreus did that, which if he had not
      done, he would have been disgracefully torpid. At least, I should have
      done so, and 1 am not any wiser than he. That was the especial reward for
      the ill-will he got. For, inasmuch as he swore by his sceptre, that the
      daughter of Brises had never been touched by him; 'tis clear that he did
      not think <a href="#linknote-1282" name="linknoteref-1282"
      id="linknoteref-1282"><small>1282</small></a> his sceptre was the Gods.
    </p>
    <p>
      May the Deities grant that you may be able to pass the threshold of the
      mistress that you have forsaken; and that your feet may aid your
      determination. And you will be able; do you only wish to adhere to your
      purpose. Now it is necessary to go with boldness, now to put spur to the
      swift steed. Believe that in that cave are the Lotophagi, <a
      href="#linknote-1283" name="linknoteref-1283" id="linknoteref-1283"><small>1283</small></a>
      in that the Syrens; add sail to your oars. The man, too, who being your
      rival, you formerly took it amiss; I would have you cease to hold him in
      the place of an enemy. But, at least, though the hatred should still
      exist, salute him. When now you shall be able to embrace him, you will be
      cured.
    </p>
    <p>
      That I may perform all the duties of a physician, behold! I will tell you
      what food to avoid, or what to adopt. The Bauman <a href="#linknote-1284"
      name="linknoteref-1284" id="linknoteref-1284"><small>1284</small></a>
      onions, or those sent you from the Libyan shores, or whether those that
      come from Megara, <a href="#linknote-1285" name="linknoteref-1285"
      id="linknoteref-1285"><small>1285</small></a> will all prove injurious.
      And 'tis no less proper to avoid the lustful rocket, and whatever else
      provokes our bodies to lust. To more advantage may you use rue that
      sharpens the sight, <a href="#linknote-1286" name="linknoteref-1286"
      id="linknoteref-1286"><small>1286</small></a> and whatever guards our
      bodies against lust. Do you enquire what I would advise you about the
      gifts of Bacchus? You will be satisfied thereon by my precepts sooner than
      you expect. Wine incites the feelings to lust, unless you take it in great
      quantities, and, drenched with much liquor, your senses become stupefied.
      By wind is fire kindled, by wind is it extinguished. A gentle breeze
      nourishes flame, a stronger one puts it out. Either let there be no
      drunkenness, or to so great an extent as to remove your anxieties; if
      there is any medium between the two, it is injurious.
    </p>
    <p>
      This work have I completed; present the garlands to my wearied bark. I
      have reached the harbour, whither my course was directed. Both females and
      males, healed by my lays, to the Poet ere long will you be fulfilling your
      duteous vows.

      was a kind of bastard Iambic line, having a Trochee (or foot of a long and
      a short syllable) in the last place, instead of an Iambus. Scazonic lines
      were much used in satirical composition.]

      784. Ovid has no reason or ground for this wretched quibble, but his own
      imagination. This sceptre of Agamemnon was made by Vulcan, who gave it to
      Jupiter, he to Mercury, and Mercury to Pelous, who left it to Atreus; by
      him it was left to Thyestes, who according to Homer, gave it to
      Agamemnon.]
